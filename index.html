                                                NFT staking refers to locking up non-fungible tokens on a platform or
                                                protocol in exchange for staking rewards and other benefits. Staking
                                                NFTs allows holders to earn an income from their collection while
                                                maintaining ownership. In the crypto world, NFTs are in vogue.
